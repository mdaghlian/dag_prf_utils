    "\n",
    "I have created several tools for plotting data on the cortical surface. This will of course require that you have surface data (i.e., run freesurfer); and any data you want to plot will need to be in a vertex wise format. pycortex (https://github.com/gallantlab/pycortex) is a very powerful way of plotting information on the cortical surface and an excellent tool. Many of the tools here are already developed in pycortex. But I have 'remade' them. The main reason for doing this is to improve my understanding of surface plotting generally, and also to improve my understanding of pycortex. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to do some simple, quick and dirty stuff these tools might be useful. Also it can be useful to have the cortical mesh in a generic format readable by any 3D rendering software (e.g., .ply), and in a way that you can send a single file anywhere, and it be instantly readable, with color and everything. \n",
